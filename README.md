# Redacted Request Extension for Burp Suite

## Description

The **Redacted Request Extension** is a powerful tool designed to enhance the security and confidentiality of HTTP request handling within the Burp Suite. Developed by **OME MISHRA**, this extension serves as a protective layer against inadvertent exposure of sensitive information present in headers such as cookies, authorization tokens, and security tokens.

## Key Features

- **Confidentiality Enhancement:** This extension acts as a safeguard for confidential information by redacting sensitive headers within selected HTTP requests.
  
- **Effortless Integration:** Seamlessly integrated into the Burp Suite, the extension adds a context menu option for users to redact and copy modified requests.
  
- **Customizable Redaction:** When the user selects "Copy Redacted Request," the extension automatically replaces sensitive headers with placeholders such as "REDACTED." This ensures that no sensitive data is inadvertently exposed.
  
- **Intelligent Redaction:** The extension specifically targets the `Cookie`, `Authorization`, and `X-Amz-Security-Token` headers, which are commonly used to carry sensitive information.
  
- **Clipboard Convenience:** After redacting the headers, the modified request is copied to the clipboard, offering a seamless experience for users to proceed with secure analysis and testing.
